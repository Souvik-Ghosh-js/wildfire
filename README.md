# GeoAI Reimagined: Natural Disaster (Wildfire) Detection and Prevention

Welcome to the repository of our project, **GeoAI Reimagined: Natural Disaster (Wildfire) Detection and Prevention**. In this repository, we present a cutting-edge solution aimed at revolutionizing wildfire detection, prediction, and response using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and satellite imagery analysis.

## High-Level Summary

Our project introduces a comprehensive wildfire detection and response system that achieves an impressive 98% test accuracy in identifying wildfires in real-time satellite imagery. Here's how our system tackles the challenge:

### How It Solves the Challenge

1. **Wildfire Detection**: Our system excels at identifying wildfires in real-time satellite imagery, even in remote or inaccessible areas, initiating an effective response promptly.

2. **Scale and Escalation Prediction**: Beyond detection, our AI system estimates the scale and potential escalation level of detected wildfires, allowing efficient resource allocation.

3. **Alert Prioritization**: The system prioritizes alerts based on the scale and potential danger, ensuring higher-level authorities are alerted when necessary, streamlining response efforts.

4. **Communication and Awareness**: Our system facilitates rapid communication with relevant authorities, firefighting teams, and volunteers, leveraging social media and media channels for faster response and evacuation.

5. **Fund-To-Go**: Integrated is the "Fund-To-Go" feature, connecting donors and NGOs with affected areas, simplifying financial aid and support for post-fire recovery efforts.

## Why It's Important

Our project holds immense significance for several reasons:

- **Enhanced Wildfire Response**: Real-time detection, prediction, and efficient alert prioritization empower authorities and firefighting teams for prompt and effective responses, potentially saving lives and property.

- **Safety**: Predicting fire spread patterns enhances the safety of firefighting teams, preventing situations where retreat routes are cut off.

- **Efficiency**: Efficient resource allocation and alert prioritization lead to more effective wildfire containment and control, reducing the overall impact on communities and ecosystems.

- **Public Awareness**: Rapid dissemination of information ensures timely evacuations and raises awareness about wildfire dangers, fostering a safer and more informed community.

- **Support for Recovery**: The "Fund-To-Go" feature directly connects donors and NGOs with affected areas, expediting financial aid and support for recovery efforts.
